#List ALL space ruins here. This file is for small things that would appear in space, like an asteroid or broken escape pod.
#Maps must be the full path to them. Any map you make but forget to list here may as well not exist as far as the game is concerned.
#Blacklisting ruins takes place in the config folder file spaceRuinBlacklist.txt, don't remove anything here unless you're removing the map entirely

#SPECIFYING AN INVALID MAP WILL RESULT IN RUNTIMES ON GAME START
